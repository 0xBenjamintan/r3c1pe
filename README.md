## Building Blocks üèóÔ∏è

To achieve its ambitious goals, R3C1PE will need to develop several key components:

### Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

Charify leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **Package Manager**: `yarn`

- **Smart Contract Development**: `Solidity`

- **Deploy**: `Mantle deploy`

- **Network**: `Ethereum-testnet, Mantle-testnet`

- **Frontend**: `next`, `react`

- **Styling**: `tailwindcss, shadcn ui`

- **Linting & Formatting**: `eslint`, `prettier`

- **Design**: `eraser.io`

### Smart Contracts

- **AccountContract.sol**: This contract aligns with the EIP 2938 standard, enabling a designated owner to execute transactions to other addresses. It encompasses key functions including initialization (`constructor`), owner-restriction (`onlyOwner`), transaction execution (`executeTransaction`) authenticated through signature verification, and signer recovery (`recoverSigner`) from a given signature. Additional functionalities include designating a payer via `setPayer`, who will be responsible for gas fees, and allowing this payer to submit transactions to the network through `executeTransactionByPayer`, while the owner retains control over signing the transactions. This structure ensures a secure and flexible transaction management system, enabling an external payer to handle gas fees, thus alleviating the owner from this responsibility. It also provides utility functions `getOwner` and `getPayer` for fetching the addresses of the owner and the payer respectively.

- **AdIndex.sol**: This contract serves as an index for storing and managing advertisements, each associated with an IPFS hash for external content referencing. The core struct `AdInfo` encapsulates information about an individual advertisement, specifically its contract address and IPFS hash. The contract maintains an array `ads` to hold all indexed advertisements. Notable functions include `indexAd` for adding a new advertisement to the index, `removeAd` for deleting an advertisement from the index, and `searchAds` for retrieving all indexed advertisements. A helper function `findAdIndex` assists in locating the index of a specific advertisement within the array. Additionally, the contract emits events `AdIndexed` and `AdRemoved` to log the addition and removal of advertisements, respectively. Through this contract, users can efficiently index, remove, and search for advertisements, while associating them with IPFS hashes for decentralized content management.

- **Advertisements.sol**: This contract, developed on Solidity version ^0.8.20 and utilizing OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` and `ECDSA` libraries, serves as a decentralized platform for managing advertisements. The core of this contract is the `Ad` struct, which holds the essential details of an advertisement including its description, Cost Per Action (CPA) offer, active status, IPFS hash for decentralized file storage, and a timestamp marking its creation. The contract manages these advertisements through a mapping called `ads`, correlating advertisers' addresses to their respective `Ad` instances, and maintains a balance ledger `advertiserBalances` for tracking funds associated with each advertiser.

Key functionalities include registering, updating, and managing advertisements, alongside managing funds for advertisers. The `registerAd`, `updateAd`, `withdrawFunds`, `payCommission`, and `depositFunds` functions enable advertisers to interact with their ads and manage their funds on the platform. The contract also provides a mechanism for executing meta-transactions, a feature crucial for Account Abstraction, as per EIP 4337 and EIP 2893, through the `executeMetaTransaction` function. This function facilitates off-chain signings and on-chain executions, improving user experience and gas optimization.

Internally, the `_registerAd`, `_updateAd`, `_withdrawFunds`, and `_payCommission` functions encapsulate the logic for registering, updating, and financial transactions related to advertisements, ensuring a clean and secure interface for external interactions. The `getAdDetails` function allows for querying ad details, and `checkAdExpiry` is used to manage the lifecycle of advertisements based on their creation timestamps.

The contract emits several events such as `AdRegistered`, `AdUpdated`, `CommissionPaid`, and `AdExpired` to provide real-time feedback and transparency on the state changes within the contract, making it a comprehensive, self-contained solution for decentralized advertisement management with added features for modern Ethereum interactions through meta-transactions.

- **Auction.sol**: The Auction contract, built on Solidity version ^0.8.20, facilitates a straightforward auction mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain. It comprises a `Bid` struct for capturing individual bid details, and an array `bids` to store all bids. The auction's status is tracked via the `auctionEnded` boolean. The lifecycle begins with `startAuction` to initialize parameters, followed by participants placing bids through the `bid` function, ensuring the auction is ongoing. Upon conclusion, `endAuction` is invoked to mark the auction's end and allocate resources based on bids. For post-auction analysis, `getWinningBids` function allows retrieval of winning bids after the auction, ensuring transparency and fair bidding environment for participants.

- **IPFSHashGenerator.sol**: The `IPFSHashGenerator` contract, crafted on Solidity version ^0.8.20, acts as a comprehensive platform for creating, storing, and verifying IPFS hashes on the Ethereum blockchain. Through three distinct events: `HashGenerated`, `HashStored`, and `HashVerified`, the contract transparently logs the activities executed within it. It employs two mappings, `userHashes` and `hashRegistry`, as repositories to link addresses with their generated hashes and to keep a record of stored hashes, respectively. The `generateHash` function enables users to create a hash from a string input, which is then converted into an IPFS-styled hash and associated with the calling address. On the other hand, `storeHash` allows users to securely store a given IPFS hash, ensuring it hasn't been registered beforehand. With the `verifyHash` function, users can ascertain the validity of a specific IPFS hash against the stored hash linked to the calling address. Lastly, the `getHash` function avails a method to retrieve the hash associated with a particular address, encapsulating the contract as a versatile tool for managing IPFS hashes within a decentralized blockchain framework.

- **Referral.sol**: The `ReferralContract` is a Solidity contract designed to manage referrals within an advertisement system on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the registration of referrers, generation of referral links tied to specific ads, recording of referral actions, and the withdrawal of commissions by referrers. Utilizing mappings, it keeps track of registered referrers, recorded actions, and the commission balances of referrers. Upon registration as a referrer, an event `ReferrerRegistered` is emitted. Referrers can generate a referral link associated with an advertisement contract and a specific ad using the `getReferralLink` function. When a referral action occurs, the `recordAction` function is employed to log the action, ensuring the referrer is registered and the action hasn‚Äôt been recorded previously, then updates the referrer's commission balance and emits an `ActionRecorded` event. Finally, referrers can withdraw their earned commissions through the `withdrawCommission` function, which ensures a positive commission balance before transferring the funds to the referrer. Through these features, the `ReferralContract` establishes a decentralized platform for handling and incentivizing referrals within a blockchain-based advertising ecosystem.

- **UserInteraction.sol**: The `UserInteraction` contract acts as an intermediary within a decentralized advertising ecosystem, facilitating user engagements with advertisements hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract is tightly integrated with an `Advertisement` contract, from which it fetches the requisite advertisement details. On initialization, the address of the `Advertisement` contract is set, establishing a direct linkage. The primary function `interact` allows users to interact with an ad, which triggers an `AdInteraction` event capturing the ad owner, interacting user, and the IPFS hash of the ad content. This mechanism ensures that each interaction is transparently recorded on-chain. Additionally, there's functionality to retrieve the IPFS content hash of an ad through `getAdContentHash`, and to verify this hash with `verifyAdContentHash`, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the ad content. 

Moreover, users can fetch complete details of an ad including its description, Cost-Per-Action (CPA) offer, active status, and IPFS hash through the `getAd` function. This contract also lays the groundwork for future enhancements. For instance, commented out functions hint at the ability to update ad content and fetch ad content from IPFS, albeit these actions are envisaged to be handled off-chain to maintain a lean on-chain footprint. This design reflects a forward-looking approach to developing a robust, decentralized advertising platform that can evolve with emerging needs and technologies, ensuring a user-friendly interface while adhering to the principles of transparency and verifiability inherent to blockchain technology.
